This is some of my Verilog/ System Verilog I have gone through personally. I have done other work in SV but they were under NDA so no bueno ^^

Description: 

  1. 5-STAGE MIPS Pipeline is a Verilog project I did back in my undergraduate junior year. This was mainly Verilog and test benches are acquired from outside source.
  2. The Operational Transconductance Amplifier is a more recent project with Cadence + SV and math:
         - The sv files are found in directory: OTA/OTA_PROJ_svrun1/ihnl/cds0 and  OTA/OTA_PROJ_svrun1/ihnl/cds1

Thank you for coming here!
